    <p>The first thought in a person's mid at the mention of the word dragon is a monstrous fire breathing animal with
        immense power. The contemporary view of dragons in the society is largely based on depictions on movies and
        books. The most
        recent depiction by Hollyhood is in the blockbuster TV show game of thrones. Even though dragons are widely
        regarded as mythical
        creatures that virtually appear around the globe, religion has increased speculations about their actual
        existance on earth at a particular time. For instance, The Book of Revelation 12 described
        the devil
        as a great <em>Dragon</em> who was cast on earth. Other segments of the religoous book refer to the devil as a
        <em>dragon</em> thereby perpetuating the view of dragons as evil creatures. Thus one's concept of the dragon in
        today's society
        is likely to be predicated on their religous belief and artistic depictions in movies and comics
    </p>
    <h4>Chinese Dragon</h4>
    <img src="Dragon1.jpg" alt="potrayal of a dragon" <p>In China, the dragon is considered the highest-ranking creature
    in Chinese animal hierarchy. Even though the
    origins are vague,its acestors could be traced to Neolithic pottery and Bronze Age ritual vessels. MAny stories in
    China capture
    the idea of rearing dragons. Chinese closely associate dragons with drought and rain such that there are many
    prayers made
    to dragons
    in Chinese texts</p>
    <h5>Modern Depictions</h5>
    <img src="Dragon3.jpg" alt="paint of dragon" <p>Dragons have been widely featured in several works in today's
    literature especially fantasy genre. Smaug
    in the classicnovel, The Hobbit, is one of the most iconic depictions today.Following discoveries in
    palaeontology fictional dragons are mostly presented no short front legs.</p>
    <h6>Personal View on Dragon</h6>
    <p>Lack of scienfic evidence on existance od dragons openned doors for many mythical theories to tell diverse
        stories about dragons. We can all agree that movies have created interesting story lines and contents on dragons
        that have not only inspired personalities but also taught vital life lessons. However, on the flip side, Dragons
        have continued to strengthen belief in myths and mystisim even in the modern society where science should take
        precedence over any other theory.</p>
